  - introduce SuS  : what are the input/output events

  - show empty model in YAKINDU

  - show on/off model

      - debug in YAKINDU

      - generate code

      - show generated code

      - run the generated code

  - continue with the examples

  - when showing the door-example, run it interactively and turn it into a test case

  - introduce assignment
