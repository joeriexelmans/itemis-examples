1. Opening the examples
=======================

  The directory 'YAKINDU_WORKSPACE' is a workspace that you can open in YAKINDU (or as they prefer to be called these days: "itemis CREATE").

  Every example will show up as a project.


2. Running the Python code
==========================


  Python Dependencies
  -------------------

    - Python >= 3 (tested with Python 3.12)
    - TkInter (included in most Python-distributions)
    - (optional) simpleaudio (for sound effects)

  Running
  -------

    To run the examples:

      python run.py <PROJECTNAME>

    for instance:

      python run.py 70_ChildLock
